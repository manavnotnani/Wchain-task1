Token-Based Lottery System
A secure and transparent decentralized lottery implementation that leverages ERC20 tokens for participation. The system features automated winner selection, participant verification, and timed rounds.
System Architecture
The lottery system consists of three main components:
Core Lottery Engine
A robust smart contract system handling participant management, token processing, and winner selection.
Key Features:

Participant authentication via whitelist
Single-entry enforcement per round
Time-controlled lottery phases
Cryptographically secure winner selection
Automated prize distribution

Token Integration
Built on standard ERC20 infrastructure:

Main Lottery Contract (LotteryEngine.sol)
Token Interface (IERC20.sol)
Test Token Implementation (Token.sol)

Security Framework

Participant validation
Rate limiting mechanisms
Temporal controls
Safe token handling

Development Setup
Environment Requirements
Set up your development environment with:
bashCopy# Core dependencies
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# Contract dependencies
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Build and Deploy

Compile the contracts:

bashCopynpx hardhat compile

Deploy to your chosen network:

bashCopynpx hardhat run deployment/lottery.js --network <your-network>
Example deployment script:
javascriptCopyasync function deployLottery() {
  const LotterySystem = await ethers.getContractFactory("LotteryEngine");
  const lottery = await LotterySystem.deploy(
    tokenAddress,
    roundDuration
  );
  
  await lottery.deployed();
  console.log(`Lottery deployed at: ${lottery.address}`);
}
Contract Interface
Administrative Functions
solidityCopyfunction addToWhitelist(address participant)
function removeParticipant(address participant)
function configureLotteryDuration(uint256 duration)
Participant Functions
solidityCopyfunction joinLottery(uint256 tokenAmount)
function checkEntryStatus()
function viewCurrentPrizePool()
System Functions
solidityCopyfunction concludeRound()
function retrieveWinner()
function checkRoundStatus()
Event System
The contract emits the following events:

ParticipantJoined(address participant, uint256 amount)
RoundCompleted(address winner, uint256 prize)
ConfigurationUpdated(uint256 newDuration)
